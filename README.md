We have five modules inventory hoursworked, jobgrade, product sales and  type of employment
In the inventory we have created a code where there are four inputs supplier,reccieving order,storing and create invoice
The process is an if then else statement  the function of this is basically if the stock is available the software will create an invoice if not it will contact the supplier for new items.
In hoursworked we have made it so that the the system tracks the hoursworked and include the rate so later on the employees salary can be calculated
In the type of employmennt the code determines the employees type of employment based on period they will work ,for example the contracted will work minimum of 3years and an employed can work for more than 3years.
In Jobgrade the code was made to identify employeess jobgrade base on a certain symbol example A,B,C,D,E,F which is determined by the manager which will later determine the salary the employees will obtain.
In product sales the function of the code is that once the product are sold our software will detect once the product is bought it will subtract if from the inventory and record  price of sale and later  add value of the sold item.
